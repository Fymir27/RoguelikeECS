# The Alchemist - A roguelike for brew lovers and poison enthusiasts

* Potions with at first unidentified properties
* Identified by use or ???
* Mix together multiple potions (1,2,..?)
* Effects accumulate or cancel each other out
* The more effects the more the mix becomes unstable. More power = riskier

## Potion properties:

### Type of application

* drink
* splash on 1 target
* splash in area
* potion releases vapours on impact
* apply to ground (trap, make hole, ...)
* apply to wall (melt wall, ...)

### Potion attributes

* swirling, bubbling, seething
* temperature (chemical reaction, boiled, cooled)
* color

### Cool potion ideas

* potion solidifies -> new (temporary wall)
* potion melts ground -> fall to next floor
* potion melts wall -> new passage
* drink potion to gain stats

## Gameplay ##

* start with 3 random potions (already identified?)
* keep track of identified potions (library)
* weapon depending on class (no weapon or armor items)
* no stats -> only modifiers from potions
* no levelups?
* find recipies / hints on scrolls
